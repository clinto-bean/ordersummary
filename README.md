## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit about where to place padding (parent vs child element), and how to handle positioning issues. 

### Continued development

I would like to continue working with flexbox and grid in order to become more comfortable with them. I tend to use grid for overall layout and flexbox for individual elements.

### Useful resources

On MDN, I looked up media vs container queries and discovered that for this particular project there was no reason for me to use a container query.
